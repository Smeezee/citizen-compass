# UPDATE

Phase 1 progress checkpoint.

**Completed and verified:**
- Ship ID registry: built (`registry-builder`), dry-run tested against the real
  `citizen_compass` Postgres DB, then run for real — all 295 ships from
  `ship_specs.json` registered with permanent codes (manufacturer + sequential
  number). Confirmed idempotent on re-run (0 new added, 295 already registered).
  Exported to `data-layer/ship_registry.json`. Manufacturer-code edge cases
  (Mirai vs MISC collision, Banu Souli mis-tagged Argo ships) resolved by
  coding from actual manufacturer name, not legacy class-name prefix, per
  your decision.
- Shared Go packages: `pkg/pipelinelog` (standardized `logs/<tool>.log`
  logging, one file per tool) and `pkg/pgconn` (shared Postgres connection
  boilerplate: find project root, read `.env`, connect) — both built, both
  used by `registry-builder` and `schema-init`.
- `watcher-go` retrofitted to use `pkg/pipelinelog` instead of its own inline
  logger — built and scratch-tested successfully.

**In progress / blocked:**
- `schema-init` (creates the shared `pipeline_check_results` table) is built
  and compiles, but the actual run against the real database was interrupted
  by a denied tool permission before it executed. Not yet confirmed against
  the real DB.
- The retrofitted watcher (using `pkg/pipelinelog`) has **not yet been
  redeployed** to the real project — the currently-running `inbox_watcher.exe`
  is still the pre-retrofit build, still logging to `pipeline_log.txt` at
  root rather than `logs/inbox_watcher.log`.

**Next steps:** run `schema-init` for real, redeploy the retrofitted watcher,
then continue Phase 1 wrap-up before moving to Phase 3.
