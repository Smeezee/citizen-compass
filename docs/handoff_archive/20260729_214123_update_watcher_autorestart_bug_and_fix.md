# UPDATE — Auto-restart bug found and fixed (2026-07-30)

## Bug
`setup_watcher_task.ps1` registered successfully and the watcher started fine, but the self-healing behavior did not actually work: killed `inbox_watcher.exe` via Task Manager, waited well past 90 seconds, it did not come back. Confirmed via Task Manager (no matching process) — not just a slow log read.

## Root cause (best diagnosis — could not get full Task Scheduler UI confirmation; its window would not accept clicks through the computer-use bridge, likely running at a different privilege level)
The previous trigger design attached a 1-minute repetition pattern directly to an `AtLogOn` trigger (`$trigger.Repetition = $repeatingOnce.Repetition` on a trigger created via `-AtLogOn`). `AtLogOn` is an event-based trigger with no fixed clock StartBoundary of its own. Repetition patterns combined with event-based triggers (AtLogOn/AtStartup) are a widely-reported unreliable combination in Windows Task Scheduler — the engine's repetition polling is anchored to a trigger's StartBoundary, which event triggers don't meaningfully have outside the moment the event fires once.

Also worth noting for the record: the previous `RepetitionDuration (New-TimeSpan -Days 3650)` was a large but *finite* duration, not the documented "indefinite" sentinel (`[TimeSpan]::Zero`). Not believed to be today's actual failure (10 years hasn't elapsed), but corrected anyway since it's the technically correct way to express "repeat forever."

## Fix applied
Rewrote the trigger section of `setup_watcher_task.ps1`:
- New primary trigger: `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At (Get-Date)` — a genuine calendar-based trigger with a real StartBoundary the engine actively polls.
- Repetition attached to that Daily trigger: 1-minute interval, `RepetitionDuration = [TimeSpan]::Zero` (the documented "repeat indefinitely" sentinel).
- Kept `AtLogOn` as a second trigger in the same task (array of two triggers), purely so it also comes up immediately on reboot instead of waiting up to a minute for the first repeat tick.
- Everything else in the script (admin elevation check, exe path check, RestartCount/RestartInterval settings, IgnoreNew, description) left unchanged.

Delivered the updated script directly onto Sleven's machine (overwriting the old `setup_watcher_task.ps1`), per his explicit standing instruction that Claude should always attempt the actual work itself before asking him to do anything manually.

## Still needs
Sleven to re-run the updated `setup_watcher_task.ps1` (right-click → Run with PowerShell → Yes on UAC) so the corrected trigger gets registered, then re-test: kill `inbox_watcher.exe`, wait ~90s, confirm it comes back on its own this time.
