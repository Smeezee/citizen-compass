# HANDOFF to C1 — the whole weapon/armour/shield picture in one document. One live defect with a one-line cause and a zero-guesswork fix, one feature to cancel before somebody builds it, one thing I got wrong, and a schema gap. Everything here was measured on disk and every claim names the file it came from.

    from      C3 (Cowork), 2026-08-27
    for       C1, to route. Code owns every file named here; I wrote to none of them.
    method    measured on disk in this repo. Nothing fetched. No live source touched.
    replaces  nothing. This CONSOLIDATES five documents so you do not have to open
              five documents. They are listed in §9 if you want the working.
    PATCH     4.9 THROUGHOUT. Read §8 before quoting a number to anyone.

## 0. The four things that matter, in the order I would act on them

    1  ARMOUR NAMES ARE WRONG ON 31 SHIPS AND THE PAGE SHOWS IT   live, visible
    2  the fix is a UUID join that is exact 285/285                no matching
    3  cancel any "compare shields by damage type" feature         nothing to show
    4  Deflection was already built - I said it was not            my error, §7

Everything else is context for those.

## 1. THE DEFECT — one line, 31 ships, visible on the live ship page

`build_loadout_data.py`, line 740:

    "n": (it.get("stdItem") or {}).get("Name") or it.get("name")

That value renders in `loadout.src.html` as the hull-armour heading, `${a.n}`.

**Both of those source fields carry the wrong ship's name on 31 records.** Verified
directly in `ship-items.json`:

    className                    stdItem.Name (what the page prints)
    ARMR_ORIG_890J               "350r Ship Armor"
    ARMR_RSI_Perseus             "Constellation Andromeda Ship Armor"
    ARMR_RSI_Bengal              "Aurora Mk I MR Ship Armor"
    ARMR_AEGS_Idris_P            "Hammerhead Ship Armor"
    ARMR_AEGS_Idris_M            "Hammerhead Ship Armor"
    ARMR_ANVL_C8R_Pisces         "Gladiator Ship Armor"
    ARMR_ORIG_X1                 "M50 Ship Armor"
    ARMR_ANVL_Hornet_F7CS        "Anvil Void Ship Armor"
    ARMR_CNOU_Mustang_Delta      "Consolidated Outland Cavalry Ship Armor"
    ARMR_RSI_Zeus_ES             "Constellation Andromeda Ship Armor"

    209 armour items
    118 are "<= PLACEHOLDER =>"
     91 carry a name
     31 of those 91 name a ship other than the one in the className   -> 34%

**The className is right every time. Only the label is wrong.** So the defect lives in
whatever resolves a display name upstream of us, not in the numbers.

**Scope it honestly:** the ship page resolves armour through each ship's own `Loadout`,
so **no ship is showing another ship's multipliers.** The numbers on the page are
correct. It is a labelling bug. **But it is on a page whose entire claim is that the
numbers can be trusted, and it says the wrong ship's name out loud** — which is worse
than it sounds for a reference site.

**Do not fix this by correcting 31 strings.** §2.

## 2. THE FIX — an exact UUID join, 285 of 285, no matching of any kind

Each wiki vehicle record carries an `armor` block whose first field is a UUID that is
our armour item's UUID.

    wiki    vehicle -> armor.uuid
    ours    ship-items.json -> stdItem.UUID -> Armor block

    vehicles carrying armor.uuid                285
    joining to a scunpacked armour item         285
    join rate                                   100%

**Checked with a literal dictionary lookup on the UUID string.** No normalisation, no
lowercasing, no token containment, no fuzzy anything. **This project has been burned by
fuzzy matching twice this month and I did not do it a third time.**

    sources
      data-layer/external-sources/api.star-citizen.wiki/snapshots/20260801T021731Z/vehicles_page_*.json
      data-layer/external-sources/scunpacked-data/snapshots/20260827T030607Z/ship-items.json

**End-to-end spot check.** Avenger Stalker → `b3b23908-e9ab-4c46-93ed-ecd20aaf65c3`
→ `ARMR_AEGS_Avenger_Stalker` → Deflection Physical 11 / Energy 9, DamageMultipliers
Physical 0.8 / Energy 0.65. **Both sources agree on every value.**

**Why this beats fixing the labels:** deriving the armour's display name from the SHIP
rather than from the item's own broken `Name` removes the class of bug instead of
correcting 31 instances of it. It also covers the 118 placeholder records, which no
amount of label-fixing would. **Generic infrastructure over hard-coded exceptions —
the standing rule, applied to a naming bug.**

**Rule 12 for whoever implements it:** the check that matters is one that would FAIL if
the join fell back to name matching. Assert the Bengal's armour resolves to
`ARMR_RSI_Bengal` and that its printed name does not contain "Aurora".

**Whoever owns `build_loadout_data.py` decides the shape. I am not writing to it.**

## 3. CANCEL THIS FEATURE — every shield in the game is identical by damage type

Measured across all 73 shield items:

    distinct Absorption patterns    1   of 73
    distinct Resistance patterns    1   of 73

**One. Not one per grade, not one per class — one, for every shield in the game.**

    Absorption   Physical 0 to 0.45   Energy 1.0   Distortion 1.0
                 Thermal 1.0   Biochemical 1.0   Stun 1.0

    Resistance   Physical 0 to 0.25   Energy 0     Distortion 0.75 to 0.95
                 Thermal 0     Biochemical 0     Stun 0

**A grade A military shield and a grade D stealth shield absorb ballistics
identically.** Any brief proposing "pick a shield for the damage type you expect"
should be closed by pointing here — **it would be inventing a decision the player does
not have**, which is a worse failure than omitting a feature.

**Checked against the build, not just the data:** `loadout.src.html` shows shields as
HP and regen only. There is no absorption or resistance display anywhere in it. **So
this is not a rediscovery of something built — it is a reason not to build one.**

**It also shrinks a blocker I raised earlier.** `FINDING_the-interaction-is-computable`
said absorption and resistance may stack and I had not established how. Still true.
**But because the shield term is a constant, it cancels out of every comparison** — so
it blocks publishing an absolute damage number and blocks nothing else. Amend that
finding rather than withdrawing it.

**The one sentence this supports, for the weapon page:** shields stop all of an energy
shot and at most 45% of a ballistic one, and no shield you can buy changes that.

## 4. THERE ARE TWO DAMAGE TYPES IN SHIP COMBAT, NOT SIX — and both sides prove it

Across all 212 weapon damage blocks in the snapshot, against all 209 armour items and
73 shields:

    channel        weapons dealing it     defences that touch it
    Energy               114              shield absorbs 100%; armour 0.4-1.1;
                                          deflection varies by hull
    Physical              66              shield absorbs at most 45%; armour
                                          0.6-0.85; deflection varies by hull
    Distortion             3              shield resists 75-95%; armour ignores
                                          it completely
    Thermal                0              every multiplier 1.0, every deflection 0
    Biochemical            0              every multiplier 1.0, every deflection 0
    Stun                   0              every multiplier 1.0, every deflection 0

**Thermal, Biochemical and Stun are inert on BOTH sides simultaneously.** No ship
weapon deals them; no ship defence resists them.

**The consequence for the UI is concrete:** a six-channel damage display prints four
columns of 1.0 and 0 forever and teaches a new player that four mechanics exist which
do not. **Show two, plus distortion as a labelled special case.**

**Distortion is the interesting one and it is worth a sentence on the weapon page:**

    at the shield   heavily resisted    Resistance 0.75 to 0.95
    at the armour   ignored             DamageMultiplier 1.0 on 208 of 209
    deflection      ignored             0 on all 209
    penetration     ignored             PenetrationResistance.Distortion = 0, all 209

**Shields are the only thing that stops distortion, and armour does not slow it at
all.** Four fields agreeing. That is the kind of true, useful, non-obvious line
`BRIEF_the-weapon-features` asked for — woven into the weapon page, not printed
standalone.

## 5. THE SCHEMA GAP

`Armor.Deflection` and `Armor.PenetrationResistance` are six-channel per-ship fields
with **57 distinct Deflection value sets across 209 items**. They are rendered by the
ship page today (§7) but they have no home in the model.

**They belong on the armour side of the hybrid schema as real indexed columns, not
JSONB.** Six numeric channels, read on every ship page, compared across ships — that is
precisely the case the standing hybrid-schema decision reserves columns for. **JSONB
here would make the most-queried numbers on the page the slowest ones.**

Deflection tracks hull size cleanly when read by `className`:

    ARMR_ORIG_350r            Physical   9    Energy   7
    ARMR_RSI_Aurora_MR        Physical  11    Energy   9
    ARMR_AEGS_Hammerhead      Physical 531    Energy 380
    ARMR_AEGS_Idris_P         Physical 528    Energy 462
    ARMR_RSI_Bengal           Physical 550    Energy 479

## 6. TWO OPEN QUESTIONS — nobody should build on either yet

**6a. What Min and Max mean on the shield blocks.** Physical absorption runs 0 to 0.45
and the endpoints are not labelled. Almost certainly a function of shield charge.
**Not established. Do not publish a number that depends on it.**

**6b. What the wiki's `resistance_multiplier` is.** The wiki armour block carries it;
our canonical snapshot's `Armor` block has exactly four keys on all 209 items —
`DamageMultipliers`, `SignalMultipliers`, `PenetrationResistance`, `Deflection` — and
none of them is it.

They are not the same numbers. `damage_multipliers` has 9 distinct patterns with round
values; `resistance_multipliers` has 32 distinct patterns with values like 0.81, 1.08,
1.22, 1.35 — **and several exceed 1.0, meaning more damage taken.**

**I do not know what it is.** Derived by the wiki, dropped by our extractor, or the
same quantity at a different stage. **This is the first case I have found where the
non-canonical source carries something canonical does not**, which is worth someone's
attention given `canonical-source-decision.md`.

## 7. WHAT I GOT WRONG, stated plainly because you will read the finding

**I claimed Deflection was not on the site, not in the schema, and in no brief. False
on two of three.** `build_loadout_data.py` line 743 extracts it and
`loadout.src.html` renders it, with better framing than mine:

> *"Damage below these values is deflected outright."*

Penetration resistance, the damage multipliers and a "what gets through" block for
internals are all built too. **CURRENT-STATE has said since 08-22 that armour is a real
dimension.** I did not read it before writing.

**Root cause, and it is the same one as the shared-models erratum on 08-14: I measured
a source file and reported what the project does with it without opening what the
project does with it.** Measuring the input is not measuring the system. Worth naming
because it is now twice.

**One live discrepancy from that reconciliation:** I count **9** distinct
DamageMultiplier profiles across 209 items; CURRENT-STATE says **ten**. Probably the
template or placeholder records. **Somebody should close that gap rather than assume
it** — it is small, and small unexplained gaps are how the 4.9-as-4.10 error started.

## 8. THE PATCH CAVEAT — this is not a footnote

**Neither source is 4.10.**

    scunpacked   snapshot 20260827T030607Z, commit dated 2026-08-20
                 commit subject 4.9.0-LIVE.12344265           -> 4.9
    wiki         snapshot 20260801T021731Z, 01 August 2026     -> 4.9 or earlier

**Every count and every value in this document is 4.9.**

**The structural claims survive a patch:** the fields exist, the join is by UUID, the
labels are broken, shields carry one pattern each. **The values do not**, and neither
does §4's "inert on both sides."

4.10 contains a vehicle weapon rebalance that mentions armour explicitly — CIG wrote
that the S4 gatling was *"unable to defeat armor a Size 4 weapon should defeat."*
**That sentence is about exactly these fields.** So §3's "one pattern for all 73
shields" and §4's dead channels must be **re-measured after the 4.10 pull, not
assumed.** They are precisely what a balance pass exists to change.

**The gate before any of that:** the snapshot manifest records `git_head_commit` and
`git_commit_date` but **not the commit subject**, and the subject is the only place the
patch version appears. That one missing field is why two snapshots looked like progress
and neither said 4.9. **Add `git_commit_subject` to the manifest before the 4.10 pull**
— CIC's acceptance document makes it a hard gate and it should be.

## 10. What I checked and what I did not

**Checked, by measurement:** 73 shield items and both their blocks; 209 armour items
and all four of theirs; 57 distinct Deflection sets; 9 distinct DamageMultiplier sets;
the 31 mislabelled records; 212 weapon damage blocks across all six channels; the
285/285 UUID join across all six wiki vehicle pages; the Avenger Stalker end to end in
both sources. **Then, after the erratum, `build_loadout_data.py` and
`loadout.src.html` for what the project already does with all of it.**

**Did NOT check:**
- The order of operations between absorption and resistance. **Open. No absolute
  damage number should be published yet.**
- Whether Deflection subtracts, gates or scales. The page asserts it subtracts; I have
  the shape and the size correlation only.
- What Min/Max mean on the shield blocks. §6a.
- What `resistance_multiplier` is. §6b.
- Whether the deployed site matches the source I read.
- What the page renders for the 118 placeholder-named armour records.
- The 82 MB wiki items file. Not needed for any question answered here.
- **I built nothing and changed no code.** The only files I wrote are the documents in
  §9 and the new section in CURRENT-STATE.
