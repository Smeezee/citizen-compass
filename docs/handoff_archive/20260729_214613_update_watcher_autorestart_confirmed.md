# UPDATE — Auto-restart fix CONFIRMED working (2026-07-30)

## Result
The Daily-trigger-with-repetition fix works. Live test:
- Sleven re-ran `setup_watcher_task.ps1` (fixed version) — registered successfully, no XML error this time (previous attempt failed with "Duration:PT0S ... incorrectly formatted or out of range" from trying to use `[TimeSpan]::Zero` as an "indefinite" sentinel — reverted that piece to the original 10-year finite duration, kept the Daily-trigger-instead-of-AtLogOn fix).
- Watcher started 21:41:20.
- Sleven ended `inbox_watcher.exe` via Task Manager.
- Confirmed via `logs/inbox_watcher.log` (read directly through the device-side mount, bypassing a stale-cache issue in the file-staging bridge): a fresh "Watcher started (Go)" sequence at 21:45:19 — full re-init (protected folders reloaded, etc.), not a stale/limping process. Came back on its own within ~1 minute of being killed.

## Status: this closes out the watcher self-healing item from the 2026-07-29 handoff.

## Remaining from the original audit queue
1. Confirm `schema-init`/`registry-builder` stay on-demand tools (not continuously running) — not yet checked this session.
2. Confirm the CLAUDE.md headless-operation standing rule is in place — CLAUDE.md already read this session; it does contain the "keep LATEST_HANDOFF.md current" standing rule. Worth a final check of whether anything else was meant by "headless-operation standing rule" specifically.
3. "AI Brain" numbered-folder knowledge base — queued as a future project per 2026-07-30 decision, not urgent.

## Note for future sessions
Reading files through the file-staging bridge (`device_stage_files` + Read/Bash) can silently return stale cached content for a path that's been staged before, even when the tool reports updated size/mtime. Workaround: use `device_bash` to `cat`/`tail` the file directly from its mount at `/sessions/<session-id>/mnt/<folder-name>/...` — that reads live, no cache issue.
