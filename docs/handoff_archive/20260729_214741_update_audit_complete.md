# UPDATE — Full audit queue closed out (2026-07-30)

All items from the 2026-07-29 "exact next step to resume from" list are now resolved:

1. ~~Run setup_watcher_task.ps1~~ — done (twice; first pass had a bug, fixed, second pass succeeded).
2. ~~Confirm it registers and starts~~ — confirmed both times via log.
3. ~~Re-test auto-restart for real~~ — confirmed: killed `inbox_watcher.exe`, it came back on its own within ~1 minute (fresh full re-init in the log at 21:45:19 after being killed post-21:41:20 start). Required a real bug fix first — see `update_watcher_autorestart_bug_and_fix.md` / `update_watcher_autorestart_confirmed.md` in this archive.
4. ~~Confirm schema-init/registry-builder stay on-demand~~ — confirmed by reading their actual Go source: both are plain single-run `main()` functions, no loops/tickers/schedulers. Only one Task Scheduler entry exists on the machine (the watcher itself).
5. ~~Confirm CLAUDE.md headless-operation standing rule is in place~~ — confirmed: the "keep LATEST_HANDOFF.md current, always" rule in CLAUDE.md is written to cover unattended/headless operation specifically (denied permissions, idle stops, section completions), not just interactive sessions.

Phase 1 wrap-up is done. Next natural step per the 2026-07-29 handoff notes: move on to Phase 3 (per PHASE2_VISION.md), or pick up the queued "AI Brain" knowledge-base project per the 2026-07-30 documentation-system decision — Sleven's call on which to prioritize.
