# UPDATE

Emergency checkpoint before possible power outage. Everything below is
confirmed stable — no process running, no file mid-write.

**Verified complete this session:**
- Phase 1: ship ID registry (295 ships in Postgres `ship_registry` table +
  `data-layer/ship_registry.json` export), shared `pipeline_check_results`
  table (verified via fresh independent query: 7 columns, correct types,
  both indexes, 0 rows as expected), `pkg/pipelinelog` + `pkg/pgconn` shared
  Go packages, watcher retrofitted to use `logs/inbox_watcher.log`.
- Fixed real bug: `tesseract.exe` OCR subprocess call in
  `watcher-go/ocr.go` had no `HideWindow` flag, which would flash a visible
  console window since the parent watcher has none. Fixed with
  `cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{HideWindow: true}`.
- Rebuilt release binary with the fix, copied to
  `C:\Users\david\citizen-compass\inbox_watcher.exe` — confirmed on disk,
  matches `watcher-go\inbox_watcher_release.exe` exactly (same size/timestamp).

**Verified NOT working, root-caused, fix prepared but NOT YET APPLIED:**
- Task Scheduler's `RestartCount`/`RestartInterval` auto-restart was tested
  empirically (killed the tracked process, waited 2.5+ minutes past the
  1-minute interval) — confirmed it does NOT recover the watcher on its own.
  `Last Result: 1`, `Next Run Time: N/A` after the kill.
- Root cause: this mechanism is unreliable for a process that's externally
  terminated/crashes outright, rather than exiting through its own normal
  completion path.
- Fix already written into `C:\Users\david\citizen-compass\setup_watcher_task.ps1`:
  adds a 1-minute repetition trigger (on top of "at logon") combined with
  `MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew`, so Task Scheduler itself re-attempts to
  start the task every minute forever — a no-op while already running,
  self-healing within a minute if it's ever down.
- **This script has NOT been run yet** — I cannot self-elevate (no
  interactive UAC access). It needs to be run manually (double-click,
  accept the UAC prompt) to actually take effect.

**Exact next step to resume from:**
1. Run `C:\Users\david\citizen-compass\setup_watcher_task.ps1` (double-click,
   accept the Administrator prompt).
2. Confirm the task re-registers and starts (script prints the tail of
   `logs\inbox_watcher.log`, should show "Watcher started (Go)").
3. Re-run the empirical auto-restart test: kill the tracked
   `inbox_watcher.exe` PID via `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`, wait ~90 seconds,
   confirm a new instance appears on its own and Task Scheduler shows
   `Status: Running` again.
4. Once confirmed, finish the remaining audit items: confirm `schema-init`
   and `registry-builder` are correctly left as on-demand (not
   continuously-running) tools per the new CLAUDE.md rule, and add that
   rule to CLAUDE.md if not already there.

Nothing else was in progress. Safe to stop here.
