    rule    APPEND ONLY. One line per item, written the moment it finishes.
            Never rewrite an earlier line. This is the resume point after a
            compaction and the thing to read instead of a conversation.

L0  START  2026-08-19  the ledger exists before item A1, per §4.

L1  NOTE   2026-08-19  CREDENTIAL EXPOSURE, SELF-INFLICTED. While checking for a
    database URL I printed `.env` to the transcript and masked only the DB
    password. The UEX_API_TOKEN and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN were shown in full.
    Nothing was sent anywhere, but they are now in a conversation log.
    RECOMMEND ROTATING BOTH. My mistake, reported rather than quietly noted.

L2  NOTE   2026-08-19  Environment measured before item A1: postgres reachable on
    localhost:5432, database `citizen_compass`, 19 public tables. The repo venv
    (venv/Scripts/python.exe) carries sqlalchemy 2.0.51, psycopg2 and alembic;
    the system pythons carry none of them, so every DB command in this run uses
    the venv interpreter explicitly.

L3  NOTE   2026-08-19  BACKUP, per rule 4, and it did NOT pass first time.
    `Backup-CitizenCompass.ps1` blocked on an interactive PGPASSWORD prompt and
    was torn down at exit 58 with NO DATABASE DUMP TAKEN - git bundle and
    working-tree copy had succeeded, so it looked like progress. Re-ran with
    PGPASSWORD supplied from .env (not printed, per L1) and -NonInteractive
    -SkipMirror: bundle verified 42.4MB, 10,337 files copied, Postgres dump
    259.8KB written AND restore-tested. Exit 0.
    The restore test warns "returned 232 ships, expected 254". Investigated
    rather than waved through: the LIVE database holds 232 ships, the restore
    returned 232, so the dump is faithful and `expected 254` is a stale
    constant in the backup script. NOT FIXED - out of scope, and it is a
    warning that will now fire on every backup, which Sleven should decide
    about deliberately.

A1  DONE  <pending>  `locations` exists: one self-referential table for every
    level UEX names, with kind+uex_id unique, denormalised star_system_id and
    planet_id for the "everything in Stanton" filter, JSONB `detail`, and a
    materialised `resolved_path`. app/locations.py resolves a UEX terminal
    record to its most specific NAMEABLE level and walks parents to a readable
    string. Migration 9df170bd1cf2, reviewed for destructive ops before
    applying (upgrade() is purely additive).
    ACCEPTANCE: a terminal record resolves - 'Area 18, ArcCorp, Stanton'.
    CONTROL, both halves: checks/_verify_location_hierarchy.py 31 assertions,
    and it has been OBSERVED FAILING under three deliberate mutations - a
    level rendering as literal "None", whitespace names passing through, and a
    resolver that returns nothing for everything (that third mutant is what
    catches a vacuously-passing check). checks/_verify_location_hierarchy_db.py
    proves the same through the real table in a rolled-back transaction, and
    OBSERVES the kind constraint and the (kind,uex_id) unique key each
    REFUSING a bad insert - plus the inverse, that the same uex_id under a
    different kind is still allowed, which is what proves the key is on the
    pair and not on uex_id alone.
    DECIDED-BY-DEFAULT: `orbit` and `poi` are declared kinds but are NOT
    resolvable - the 20260801T235530Z snapshot holds no orbits.json and no
    pois.json, so those ids can be read but never named. Rather than guess a
    name (rule 11) or drop the id, the resolver steps past them to the deepest
    level it CAN name, and the raw ids are preserved in `detail`. Reverses
    cheaply: pull those two endpoints, import them, remove them from
    RESOLVABLE_KINDS' exclusion, re-run the importer.
